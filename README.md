## General Information
- Determine the disease name and its probable treatment from the dataset and list it out in the form of a table or a dictionary.

- train_label, test_label provides label mapped for disease & treatment in each line.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
